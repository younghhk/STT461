# STT 461: Computations in Probability and Statistics

In this course we will cover computational methods commonly used in statistics, including algorithms used for fitting and non-linear regressions, maximum likelihood estimation, simulation of random variables, bootstrap, cross-validation and algorithms for implementing high dimensional regressions.

**Instructor**: Hyokyoung G. Hong. (hhong@msu.edu)

**Office hours**: Mon and Wed: 2:00 pm- 3:00 pm Wells Hall C435

**TA Office hours**: Jialin Qu (qujialin@stt.msu.edu) Fri: 9:00 am-11:00 am Wells Hall C522

**Software**: The course will be mostly based on [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

**Approach**: Although the focus of the course is on computational methods, for each topic we will first describe the problem from a statistical perspective. If they exist, exact analytical solutions will be discussed and implemented. Otherwise numerical methods will be presented. Derivations will be presented in class and students are expected to take their own notes. Scripts for computations will be developed in class and a summary will be posted in this repository. Students are expected to bring their own laptops. If you do not have access to a laptop, please check with the instructor to get access to one.

**Evaluation**: The evaluation will be based on biweekly HW and two in-class exams.

**Textbook**:  There is no required textbook. However, the following are good textbooks that will guide
you learning about statistical analyses in R.

[Statistical computing with R](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Computing-with-R/Rizzo/p/book/9781584885450). Maria L. Rizzo, Chapman & Hall

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/index.html). This book covers many of the topics we will discuss.
